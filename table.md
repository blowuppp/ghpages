| Tool | What it is | Best for |
|---|---|---|
| GitHub Proper (Repos) | The "core" cloud storage for your Git projects. | Version control, collaboration, and code backup. |
| GitHub Gists | Single-file or small snippet hosting. | Sharing one-off scripts, notes, or code blocks without a full repo. |
| GitHub Pages | Free static web hosting. | Personal portfolios, project documentation, or simple static sites. |
| GitHub Codespaces | Full cloud-based dev environment (VM). | Coding from anywhere with a terminal; no local setup needed. |
| GitHub.dev (The . Key) | Lightweight, browser-based VS Code editor. | Quick text edits or reviewing code without spinning up a VM. |
| GitHub Actions | Automation engine (CI/CD). | Auto-running tests, deploying to Netlify, or notifying your Headscale network. |
| GitHub Copilot | AI-powered coding assistant. | Writing code faster, fixing bugs, and generating documentation. |
| GitHub Projects | Kanban-style planning boards. | Organizing your "To-Do" lists, tracking bugs, and managing your roadmap. |
| GitHub CLI (gh) | A command-line tool for GitHub. | Managing PRs, Issues, and Codespaces directly from your terminal. |
| GitHub Issues | A feedback and bug tracking system. | Recording tasks, feature requests, and discussions linked to code. |
| GitHub Packages | A private registry for software bits. | Hosting your own Docker images or npm packages for reuse. |
| GitHub Discussions | A forum-style space for communities. | Asking general questions about a project without opening a specific "issue." |
